    description: 'This repo provides a simple example of a ReAct-style agent with a tool to save memories, implemented in JavaScript. This is a straightforward way to allow an agent to persist important information for later use. In this implementation, we save all memories scoped to a configurable `userId`, enabling the bot to learn and remember a user\'s preferences across different conversational threads.',
